# AD-Lab-2025
 My experience learning active directory using Josh Madakor's video.
 
This lab is just a demonstration of implementing active directory using virtual machines.

## Technology
- VirtualBox
- Active Directory Domain Services
- Powershell

## Operating Systems
- Windows Server 2025
- Windows 10 

## Deployment

## Extra notes
Not sure why but for my installation, I needed to go into my virtual box file through the command line and enter this command "./VBoxManage modifyvm "DC" --hpet on" in order for the VM to not boot instantly and hang.
